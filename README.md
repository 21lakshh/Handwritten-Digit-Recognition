# Handwritten Digit Classification using the MNIST Dataset

## Overview
This project demonstrates a handwritten digit classification system built using the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy, leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  

The dataset, sourced from Keras, consists of:  
- **Training Data**: 60,000 examples  
- **Test Data**: 10,000 examples  

The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of performance using a confusion matrix and a heatmap.

## Features
- **Data Scaling**: The input pixel values (0-255) are scaled to a range of 0-1 for better predictions.  
- **Model Performance**:  
  - Training Accuracy: **99.40%**  
  - Test Accuracy: **97.39%**  
- **Confusion Matrix & Heatmap**: Provides insights into model predictions and errors.
